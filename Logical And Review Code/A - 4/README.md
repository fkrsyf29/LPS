# LPS A-4

### Analysis

1. The Main method creates an instance of List and enters an infinite loop where it repeatedly adds Product objects to the list without ever clearing it.
2. Each iteration of the loop adds 1000 new Product objects to the list, but it never removes or disposes of them. This behavior causes the list to grow indefinitely, consuming more memory with each iteration.
3. The Product class itself is simple and does not directly contribute to the memory leak issue.

### Improvements

To fix the memory leak issue, we need to ensure that unnecessary references to Product objects are removed from memory.  One way to achieve this is by using a using statement to automatically dispose of the Product objects after they are added to the list. 

Here's the rewritten code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace MemoryLeakExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            while (true)
            {
                var myList = new List<Product>(); // Create a new list for each iteration
                // populate list with 1000 integers
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
                {
                    // Using statement to ensure proper disposal of Product objects
                    using (var product = new Product(Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), i))
                    {
                        myList.Add(product);
                    }
                }
                // do something with the list object
                Console.WriteLine(myList.Count);
            }
        }
    }

    class Product : IDisposable
    {
        public Product(string sku, decimal price)
        {
            SKU = sku;
            Price = price;
        }
        public string SKU { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }

        // Dispose method to release any resources
        public void Dispose()
        {
            // Implement IDisposable pattern if necessary
        }
    }
}


```

### Explanation:

1. I moved the declaration of myList inside the loop so that a new list is created for each iteration.
2. I've added a using statement around the creation of each Product object within the loop. This ensures that each Product object is disposed of after it is added to the list, releasing any resources associated with it.
3. I've also implemented the IDisposable interface in the Product class. If the Product class holds any unmanaged resources, the Dispose() method can be used to release those resources.

By using the using statement and implementing proper disposal mechanisms, we can ensure that unnecessary references to Product objects are removed, thus preventing memory leaks and excessive memory consumption.
