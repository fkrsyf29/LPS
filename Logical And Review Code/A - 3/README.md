# LPS A-3

### Analysis

The Laptop class lacks proper encapsulation, as the Os property is publicly accessible and can be modified directly.
The attempt to access the Os property directly from the Laptop class using Console.WriteLine(Laptop.Os) is incorrect since Os is an instance property, not a static property.

### Improvements

To improve the code, we can make the Os property private and provide a public method to access it. Additionally, we can modify the way we access the Os property to do so from an instance of the Laptop class rather than the class itself.

Here's the rewritten code:
```csharp
class Laptop
{
    private string _os; // private member

    public Laptop(string os)
    {
        _os = os;
    }

    public string GetOs() // public method to access the Os property
    {
        return _os;
    }
}
var laptop = new Laptop("macOs");
Console.WriteLine(laptop.GetOs()); // Output: macOs

```

### Explanation:

I changed the Os property to a private field _os, ensuring that it can't be directly accessed or modified from outside the class.
I introduced a public method GetOs() to retrieve the value of the _os field. This method encapsulates the access to the Os property and allows controlled access to it.
When creating an instance of the Laptop class, the Os property is set through the constructor. To retrieve the Os property value, you should call the GetOs() method on an instance of the Laptop class.
