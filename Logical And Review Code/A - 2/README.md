# LPS A-2

### Improvements

The old code appears to be well-structured and fulfills its purpose. However, if we want to make it more flexible or improve readability, we could consider the following:
1. Parameterization: If the values of Path and Name should be provided externally or vary based on certain conditions, we can modify the method to accept these values as parameters.
2. Error Handling: If there's a possibility of encountering errors during the creation of ApplicationInfo, we might want to incorporate error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks.

Here's the rewritten code considering the above points:
```csharp
public class ApplicationInfo
{
    public string Path { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public ApplicationInfo GetInfo(string path, string name)
{
    // Check if either path or name is null or empty
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("Path and name cannot be null or empty.");
    }

    var application = new ApplicationInfo
    {
        Path = path,
        Name = name
    };

    return application;
}


```


In this version, the method GetInfo() now accepts path and name as parameters, allowing flexibility in specifying these values when calling the method.
